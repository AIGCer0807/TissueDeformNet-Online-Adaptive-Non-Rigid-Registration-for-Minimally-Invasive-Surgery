# TissueDeformNet-Online-Adaptive-Non-Rigid-Registration-for-Minimally-Invasive-Surgery
A novel framework for non-rigid registration in minimally invasive surgery, leveraging overlap-aware hierarchical matching and online adaptation to handle significant tissue deformations and partial overlaps. The method achieves robust and accurate performance without additional training data, validated on both artificial and clinical datasets.
